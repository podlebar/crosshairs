# Crosshairs

Crosshairs is a screen measurement app for Mac OS X, previously released by my now defunct company [Giant Comet](http://giantcomet.com/crosshairs/), now provided as free, open-source app. I built it 2010, so it could use some updating. It was pre-ARC and before retina screens came out.

**Note: I'm not actively maintaining or updating this app, I open-sourced just in case it's useful to anyone**
